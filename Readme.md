# Modeling Semi-Autonomous Vehicle Driving for Indian Terrain
CS637A Embedded & Cyber-Physical Systems course project

Modern passengers vehicles are quipped with computational, sensing and actuating capabilities which enable the design of systems that can autonomously 
control the vehicle motion in order to assist the driver. In this project we intended to develop a safety system which utilizes a predictive controller
to guide a vehicle through an obstacle free path in a safe manner. This is a combined lane keeping, stability control and collision avoidance problem.
